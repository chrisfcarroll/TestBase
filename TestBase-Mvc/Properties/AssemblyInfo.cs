[assembly: AssemblyDescription(@"*TestBase* gets you off to a flying start when unit testing projects with dependencies.
TestBase-Mvc adds a rich extensible set of fluent assertions for verifying Mvc ActionResults and for easy setup of ControllerContext and HttpContext for both Mvc and WebApi
TestBase.Shoulds
-------------------
Chainable fluent assertions get you to the point concisely
ControllerUnderTest.Action()
  .ShouldbeViewResult()
  .ShouldHaveModel&lt;TModel&gt;()
  .ShouldEqualByValue(expected)
ControllerUnderTest.Action()
  .ShouldBeRedirectToRouteResult()
  .ShouldHaveRouteValue(""expectedKey"", [Optional] ""expectedValue"");

ShouldHaveViewDataContaining(), ShouldBeJsonResult() etc.

----------
Controller extensions to fake the http request &amp; context. By injecting the RegisterRoutes method of your
